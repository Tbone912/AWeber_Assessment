# AWeber_Assessment
CRUD API for AWeber

This is designed to be a lightweight database for a single person on a single computer.
The biggest problem currently is UPDATE acts more like INSERT and does not retrieve the CREATED_DATE field.

To run this program, open it in your IDE, and then go to:
http://127.0.0.1:5000

Finally, I'm more familiar with Java/Spring Boot and have even solved the UPDATE issue before at work.
